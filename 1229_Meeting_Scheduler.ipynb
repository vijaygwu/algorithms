        "   - It filters out any slots that are shorter than the required `duration`, as they can't possibly work.\n",
        "   - Each slot is represented as a pair `[start_time, end_time]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sorting with a Heap**:\n",
        "   - It converts the filtered list of time slots into a min heap, which automatically sorts them by start time.\n",
        "   - This makes it efficient to always process the earliest slot first.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Finding Overlaps**:\n",
        "   - The algorithm then processes the heap, popping the earliest time slot (`start1`, `end1`).\n",
        "   - It peeks at the next earliest slot (`start2`, `end2`), which is at index 0 of the heap.\n",
        "   - It checks if there's a sufficient overlap between the two slots: if `end1 >= start2 + duration`, it means there's at least `duration` time available from `start2`.\n",
        "   - If such an overlap exists, it returns `[start2, start2 + duration]`, which is the earliest common time slot of the required duration.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Edge Case**:\n",
        "   - If the algorithm processes the entire heap without finding a suitable overlap (or if there were fewer than 2 valid slots to begin with), it returns an empty list `[]` to indicate that no common time slot of the required duration exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity is O((n+m) log(n+m)) where n and m are the lengths of the two input arrays, due to the heap operations. The space complexity is O(n+m) for storing the combined and filtered time slots.\n"
