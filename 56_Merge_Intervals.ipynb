        "This code solves the \"Merge Intervals\" problem, which requires combining overlapping intervals into a single continuous interval. Let me explain how it works in detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Definition\n",
        "- **Input**: A list of intervals, where each interval is represented as `[start, end]`\n",
        "- **Output**: A new list of non-overlapping intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "The solution follows a logical step-by-step process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sort by Start Time**: First, sort all intervals by their starting value\n",
        "2. **Process Linearly**: Go through each interval once, merging when necessary\n",
