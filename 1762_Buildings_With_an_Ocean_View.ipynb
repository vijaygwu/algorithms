        "   - If the newcomer is **taller or equal** to the one on top of the stack, that top building loses its ocean view. Pop it.  \n",
        "   - Keep popping until the top is taller than the newcomer (or the stack is empty).  \n",
        "   - Push the newcomer index; it might block someone to its left later, but for now it has a clear line of sight.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Order is preserved**  \n",
        "   - Because we scan left → right and only push once per index, the final stack already contains indices in ascending order, exactly as required.\n",
