        "# Binary Search Tree (BST) Data Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure in computer science that organizes data in a hierarchical structure. Here are the core characteristics and operations of a BST:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Characteristics\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Node Structure**: Each node in a BST contains:\n",
        "   - A key (and possibly an associated value)\n",
        "   - A reference to a left child node\n",
        "   - A reference to a right child node\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Binary Search Property**: The defining characteristic of a BST is its ordering:\n",
        "   - All keys in a node's left subtree are less than the node's key\n",
        "   - All keys in a node's right subtree are greater than the node's key\n",
        "   - This property must be true for every node in the tree\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **No Duplicate Keys**: Standard BSTs typically don't allow duplicate keys, though some implementations may handle them by:\n",
        "   - Storing them in the right subtree\n",
        "   - Using a counter for duplicate occurrences\n",
        "   - Allowing same-value keys with different associated values\n",
        "\n",
        "## Basic Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Search**: Find a node with a given key\n",
        "   - Time Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree\n",
        "   - Best case: O(log n) for balanced trees\n",
        "   - Worst case: O(n) for unbalanced trees\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Insertion**: Add a new node with a given key\n",
        "   - Time Complexity: Same as search\n",
        "   - Process: Navigate down the tree comparing keys until finding the right leaf position\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Deletion**: Remove a node with a given key\n",
        "   - Three cases:\n",
        "     - Node with no children: Simply remove it\n",
        "     - Node with one child: Replace with its child\n",
        "     - Node with two children: Replace with in-order successor (smallest node in right subtree)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Traversal**: Visit all nodes in a specific order\n",
        "   - In-order (left, root, right): Visits nodes in ascending key order\n",
        "   - Pre-order (root, left, right): Useful for creating a copy of the tree\n",
        "   - Post-order (left, right, root): Useful for deleting the tree\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "- Symbol tables and dictionaries\n",
        "- Priority queues\n",
        "- Used to construct other data structures like sets and multisets\n",
        "- Database indexing\n",
        "- Expression parsers\n",
        "- Routing tables in networking\n",
        "\n",
        "## Balanced BSTs\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard BSTs can become unbalanced, leading to O(n) operation times. Balanced BST variants maintain better performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- AVL Trees: Height-balanced trees, ensuring O(log n) operations\n",
        "- Red-Black Trees: Color-balanced trees with good practical performance\n",
        "- B-Trees: Generalization of BST used in file systems and databases\n",
        "\n",
        "## Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations (when balanced)\n",
        "- Naturally sorts elements during insertion\n",
        "- Simple implementation compared to many other advanced data structures\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Performance degrades if tree becomes unbalanced\n",
        "- No direct access to elements (unlike arrays)\n",
        "- Slightly more complex than basic data structures like arrays and linked lists\n"
